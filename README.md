>Typescript can be understood as a wrapper language around javascript which enables a lot of features which javascript is lacking currently. Example compilation time type checking , interfaces etc . This brings the power of a strongly typed language to javascript. Typescript files are compiled to javascript files (.ts -> .js)

**Example command: tsc app.ts -> app.js**
